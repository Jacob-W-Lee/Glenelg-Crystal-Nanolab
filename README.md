Glenelg Crystal Nanolab NASA Hunch Code
Since 1989, research has shown that crystals grow differently in low gravity. Recent data collected by NASA has shown that 40% of crystals grown in space are of a higher quality than those grown on Earth. The quality of a crystal is usually determined on a grade scale from A-D with A being the highest quality and D being the lowest quality. Because of this phenomenon, scientists and researchers want to conduct more crystal growth experiments, which could then be used to improve many drugs, computer chips, and metals. Additionally, research from the National Center for Biotechnology Information supports that 20% of microgravity crystals are larger than crystals grown on Earth, with the average size on Earth being 0.5mm^3 compared to the average size of 6mm^3 in space. Developing a Nanolab for crystal growth in space is essential because over 1,000 crystal growth experiments have been conducted since 2000 on the ISS according to the ISS National Lab, which averages about 50 experiments per year.
